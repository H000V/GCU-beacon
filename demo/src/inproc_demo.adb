--  In-process demo: the acceptance test for semester one.
--
--    Sensor      task, publishes Reading at ~1 kHz to Temperature_Topic
--    Controller  task, publishes Command at ~10 Hz to Command_Topic
--    Main        consumes both for two seconds and prints the numbers
--
--  What it must show:
--    Command_Topic (Reliable):     Dropped = 0, every command seen in order.
--    Temperature_Topic (Best_Effort): drops under sustained rate, and the
--    last value received is the most recent one published.
--
--  Exit status is non-zero if either property fails, so CI can run it.
