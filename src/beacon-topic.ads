--  Beacon.Topic: one instantiation per message type.

--
--  Everything a publisher sends and a subscriber receives is a
--  Message_Type. There is no other path (design rule 1).
--
--  Static model (design rule 4): the instantiation owns a fixed table of
--  at most Max_Subscribers. Subscribers register at startup, before any
--  Publish. Registration is not task-safe by design; publishing is.
--
--  Single writer: one Publisher per instantiation. Create_Publisher
--  refuses a second one.
--
--  Runtime needs: protected types with entries, so light-tasking
--  (Ravenscar / Jorvik) or full. Not ZFP. On ZFP use Beacon.Queue directly.
